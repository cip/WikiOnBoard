h1. Getting started

h2. Supported devices

Currently only Symbian based mobile phone are supported. Most touch and non-touch devices which are based
 on S60rd FP1  or later versions are supported. This includes mobile phones like Nokia N95, N82, N97,5800 or N8.

It is planned to add support for Maemo, Linux and Windows in the future.

h2. Install

h3. Symbian^1 and Symbian^3 mobile phones (For example Nokia N8, C7, 5800, N97)

WikiOnBoard 1.0 is now availabe in ovi store. Please download it using the Ovi Store App on your mobile or download it on your PC from "here":http://store.ovi.com/content/148305.

Note, that the ovi store version is slightly newer than the versions in the download section of this site. 

h3. S60 3rd edition, feature pack 1 or later (For example N82, E75)

To install download the latest "WikiOnBoard_installer_0.0.37.sisx":https://github.com/downloads/cip/WikiOnBoard/WikiOnBoard_installer_0.0.37.sisx  from the download section, recommended is to download directly from your mobile phone's webbrowser. Open the downloaded file on your phone and follow the instructions.

Note, that the Qt installer requires an internet connections to download a significant amount of data (10-20 Mb). Thus either use wireless lan to connect your phone, or take care that you have a cheap data rate.  Alternatively, you can also download a version "without the Qt installer":https://github.com/downloads/cip/WikiOnBoard/wikionboard_0.0.37.sis. Qt has then to be installed separately.

h2. Download Wikipedia (or other zim-file)

See "Get-eBooks":Get-eBooks.html where to download the Wikipedia or other eBooks in zim-format and how to it them on your mobile.


h2. Open and use WikiOnBoard

After installation you can find WikiOnBoard in you mobile phone's application menu. 
After opening it you will see a pretty empty screen. Use "Options/Open Zimfile" to open the file you have downloaded in the last step. If you stored it on the memory card, you can typicall find it on drive e. In particular on non-touch devices this  step is pretty awkward, but fortunately you won't have to this frequently, as the last opened file is opened automatically next time you start WikiOnBoard.

When you have managed to do all this, it should be pretty self-explaining how to use it. Somethings to keep in mind:
* Search is case sensitive. In the wikipedia all articles start with a capital letter, so if you cannot find anything useful it may be because your search term does not. The search input per default  switches automatically to capital letter for the first letter
* Keys 8 and 2 can be used to scroll through an article. This is in particularly useful if there are lot of links in the current section of the article, for example in the table of content.
 
h2. Troubleshooting and Feedback
