WikiOnBoard 2 is now available in Nokia Store. 
 
Update or download with the Nokia Store
App on your phone, or download it with your PC from [here](http://store.ovi.com/content/148305).

#### New in WikiOnBoard 2

- Improved user interface
- New library view allows easy switching between different Wikipedia offline versions stored on your phone
- Split-screen virtual keyboard in article search
- Forward in history added to article view
- Fix: On some mobile phones it was not possible to open a file. While this apparently was a problem with the phone's configuration and not a bug in the app, it should not occur anymore as file selection is implemented differently.

WikiOnBoard 2 only supports Symbian^3 mobile phones, such as Nokia N8, C7, 500, 603 or 701. 

For older mobile phones, such as Nokia 5233, WikiOnBoard 1 stays available in Nokia Store.
