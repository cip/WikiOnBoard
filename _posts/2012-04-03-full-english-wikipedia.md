Thanks to the Kiwix team a full english Wikipedia version without
pictures is finally available.

Visit [kiwix.org](http://kiwix.org) and download "English Jan-2012 All (no pictures)". 

Note, that the downloaded file cannot be copied directly to the
mobile phone. It needs to be split into smaller parts before. 
Please read [Get-eBooks]({{BASE_PATH}}/Get-eBooks.html) to find out how to perform
the splitting.

Other good news is that the Kiwix team plans to provide pre-split files for download in the future.
So if you don't want to split yourself, it's worth checking back later.
