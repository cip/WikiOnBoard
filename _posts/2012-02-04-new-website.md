WikiOnBoard has now a new [website](http://cip.github.com/WikiOnBoard). Main reason is that accessing
the [wiki](https://github.com/cip/WikiOnBoard/wiki) - which has been in use before - from the mobile app leads to 
a certificate error. New - not released yet - app versions are going to link to the new website which does not
have this issue. 

However, the wiki stays online for
now, mainly because the currently released app versions link to it. 

Note, that the new site mentions WikiOnBoard 2. This version is not available yet, but I plan to release it in
the next weeks. It's basically finished, except for some translations. However, the [kiwix](http://www.kiwix.org) project 
plans to release an english wikipedia without pictures zim file in the near future. As this would be very useful for WikiOnBoard,
I'd like to wait with the release until this zim file is actually available.
